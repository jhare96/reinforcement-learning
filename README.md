# reinforcement-learning

A small reinforcement learning library used for MSc dissertation project at the University of Sheffield.  
This repository has working implementations of the following reinforcement agents  
 Markup : 1. Advantage Actor Critic (A2C)  
          2. Synchronous n-step Double Deep Q Network (Sync-DDQN)  
          3. Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO)  
          4. Random Network Distillation (RND)  
          5. UNREAL-A2C2, A2C-CNN version of the UNREAL agent  
          6. Random Network Distillation with Auxiliary Learning (RANDAL), novel solution combining UNREAL and RND agents
